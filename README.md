# BF1LuaDC
Trying to create a basic BF1 lua decompiler

Currently it can do basic bytecode reads (.script files reversed using "luac -l name.script > name.txt")
Only tested on addme and mission lua files.

I privatized this codebase on 10/8/20 because there is a person that, even though the license is very freeing, feels the need to copy and pass this off as his own.  As such, I invited the other collaborator, BAD-AL, and when I get back to working on it, I'll consult about deploying the new code under a different license.
